# API Details #

The Social Mention API provides a single stream of real-time search data aggregated from numerous social media properties.

An API call initializes live querying of each social media source and the data is sorted, processed, and normalized.

Search query data is not currently archived therefore results are limited to the X most recent items from each social media source. Where X is the data limit set by the social media source itself, for example Twitter currently has a data limit of 100 items.

**Commercial Usage**

For commercial applications of the data, or usage above the daily rate limit - there is a monthly fee. While the data is provided free - the monthly fee covers bandwidth and maintenance of the API. The monthly licensing fee is based on the amount of API usage. Please refer to the [API Terms of Use](APITermsOfUse.md) for additional information.
